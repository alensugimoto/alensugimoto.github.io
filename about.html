          <div class="about-me">
            <p>
              When I was a little boy,
              I would handcraft toys.
              I would assemble Lego Star Wars ships
              such as the X-Wing,
              construct airplanes and hobby kits,
              and make objects from scratch out of cardboard and tape.
              My imagination would bring the new toys to life.
              As I got older,
              I would build things
              that moved the way I could have only imagined before.
              I once made a putt-putt boat
              that pushed itself on water
              by the force resulting from the expulsion of steam
              from its simple engine.
              At school,
              I was able to design and build the winning sumo bot
              for a semester-end project in an Electronics 11 class.
              I also assembled a trebuchet
              that flung objects as far as four meters.
              At home, I enjoyed building balsa wood airplanes,
              which were able to fly
              with their propellers thrusting them forward.
              My passion for crafting these types of toys
              was the leading factor
              that connected me with computer science.
            </p>

            <p>
              In grade ten,
              I enrolled in an in-class course on Visual Basic.
              Since programming relates to the kind of crafting
              I am passionate about,
              in which function takes priority over appearance,
              it was just as entertaining as making toys.
              Therefore, I eagerly taught myself the basics of Python
              and enrolled in another in-class course on Java.
            </p>

            <p>
              In my senior year of high school,
              I completed a graduation project
              on a computer-science-related topic.
              Using MATLAB, I wrote an algorithm
              that finds the general shape of the fastest base running path
              from home to second base on a baseball field.
            </p>

            <p>
              Due to all the experience,
              I am now following my passion for both crafting and programming
              through the field of computer science.
